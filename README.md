#Phase 1 Project

###This application is run on a json server. It displays a table ranking the pokemon with the highest base stats, it also has a column for the mascot with some information. At the bottom is a form, this allows the user to enter the name of their favorite pokemon, as well as a link to a picture of that pokemon and create a section that displays all of the user's favorite pokemon. The json file will have three already displayed on the page, which can be removed by clicking the X button. This allows the user to keep adding and removing pokemon based on if they still want that pokemon as their favorite.
